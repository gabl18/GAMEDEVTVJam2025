Hi, this is Timmy's mom and it appears that my son has been bothering you and wasting my money on StUpiD F**** *** * *** ***SNOWY *** * GLOBES. anyways...

I am deeply sorry for any inconvienience that my son may have caused. I looked trough your shop and noticed that you produce great work. ü•∞ I would really love if you could produce another globe for little Timmy.

Hello Broster, I am a Blockcraft MeTuber with over 10 Million Stalkers and I would really apprechiate if you could prepare a #gamerpro Snow Globe 3001. Like just... uhm.. like, just do something that I would really like, just surprise me. Just like when I lost all my money at the Casino #yolo or when I had my first ever shower. My favorite Color is Pink (of course because its the color of my Blockcraft skin), so I would really apprechiate if you could use this color somewhere. I usually dont go outside, but I hope that I can get to your shop either in 2 or 3 days. And I hope you dont have any grass near your shop bc I am doing the dont touch any grass challange #coool!
See ya!

Hi, I saw your shop online and thought I definetly had to come visit your store. You are definetly doing some great work. So, to get to my order. I havent exactly looked what you have as options, but I recently travelled with my friends Gabe and Nora and would really want something that lets me think back to the great time we had. If it is possible, could you also put use some blue for the base or sth like that? Thanks for everything in advance, happy to get the product! 

Frank (frank_wood@inlook.com)
Uhm, hello... This is kinda akward - but I would want to order one of your uhm, globes for my girlf- uhm just friend I mean, I uuh think she really likes Paris, so maybe you have something like France themed or sth like that. Uhm, I am also almost certain that she would like a wodden base for the globe. T- thanks for doing that üôè maybe she will lo- uhm like me more with that gift.

Hello, I hope you have a schnitzel-tastic day! 
We are reaching out to you from the "Schnitzel-Factory" next to your Shop, we would like to see some of your    .
We will send a employee to pick up the globe in the next few days.
Thank you.

Schnitzelman (dialoge)
Hi, I am here to pick up the globe, I was sent here by the "Schnitzel Factory " because they always send me for the dumb shit. After my wife left me and took the kids, ther's not much more to live for... Why am I even talking to you, I should go see a therapist but I am broke.. I don't even have money for food. Sometimes I just chew on my costume because I am that hungry..
